I am unable to attach the compiled html file type on GitHub, therefore, I provided the necessary code on the file that is used to create my visuals to display on my GitHub. 

Analysis and Testing Few’s Recommendations

Stephen Few's recommendations for data visualization, particularly for distribution analysis, often include:

Simplification: Avoid unnecessary clutter and complexity. In your visualizations, use clean, minimal designs that help the user focus on the distribution of data without distractions.

Grid Layouts: When comparing multiple variables, use grid layouts (e.g., facet_wrap) to avoid having separate, disjointed plots. This enables a direct comparison between distributions, making it easier for the viewer to see patterns or differences.

Clear Axes and Labels: Make sure that axes are clearly labeled, and units of measurement are included, which helps the viewer understand what is being plotted and makes the visualization more accessible.

Opinion on Few’s Recommendations:

In your testing, you might find that Few’s emphasis on clarity and comparison through grid layouts helps make the analysis more intuitive. The ability to compare distributions side by side in a grid layout allows you to spot relationships and trends more easily than if the plots were presented separately.

For example, comparing mpg with horsepower (hp) or weight (wt) in separate histograms or scatter plots might obscure the relationships between these variables, while a grid of plots or a faceted scatter plot could provide insights on how these variables interrelate.
